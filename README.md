# Turing_Duck_Hunt
I coded this in programming class in 10th grade. It's made in an educational language called Turing. 

## How to run
To run, download all the files and run DuckHunt.exe in the same folder. If you don't trust the executable, you can download Turing 4.1.1 [here](http://compsci.ca/holtsoft/) and open DuckHunt.t from turing.exe. Code might be laggy on slower hardware.
